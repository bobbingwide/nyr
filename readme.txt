== Description ==
Block based theme using All Bootstrap Blocks

Depends on the All Bootstrap Blocks plugin as it uses Bootstrap 5 functionality such as:
- bootstrap carousel with fade and slider
- collapsible content
- bootstrap containers, rows and columns
- bootstrap CSS classes 

Uses bespoke shortcodes:

- [nyr_carousel] to display the carousel on the home page.
- [nyr_carousel_images] to display attached images for projects.

Overrides the:

- core/post-terms block
- areoi/column block from All Bootstrap blocks
- core/term-description block
